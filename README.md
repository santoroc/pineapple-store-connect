# pineapple-store-connect

This Python SDK simplifies the process of connecting to the App Store Connect API for reporting purposes. It provides a streamlined interface for downloading sales and subscription reports, eliminating the need for manual HTTP logic and API parameter handling. With this SDK, you can focus on your data, not the details of API interaction.

## Installation

```
pip install pineapple-store-connect
```

## Using pineapple-store-connect to download the sales report

```python
from pineapple.client import AppStoreClient

private_key = """<your-private-key-here>"""
vendor_number = '<your-vendor-number-here>'
key_id = '<your-key-id-here>'
issuer_id = '<your-issuer-id-here>'

client = AppStoreClient(vendor_number=vendor_number, key_id=key_id,
                        issuer_id=issuer_id, private_key=private_key)

report_date = '<your-report-date-here>'
report_file = client.fetch_sales_report(report_date)

with open(f'appstore_sales_{report_date}.csv', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(report_file)
